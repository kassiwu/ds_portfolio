## [Project 1: TaylorFit (Collaborative Project)](www.taylorfit-rsa.com)
![](/images/TaylorFit.png)

This is a web application that serves as a data analytics tool utilizing multivariable polynomial regression models and allows users to create a predictive model from a numerical dataset.

#### Use Cases / Examples
* Plant Growth - Predicting Crop Yield
* Navy - Predicting Lift Capacity of a Helicopter
* Stock Market - Predicting S&P 500

#### Technologies
* KnockoutJS
* Javascript
* Coffeescript
* Stylus
* Webpack
* C3.js

#### My Contributions
* Created a graphical comparison between two distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other (QQ Plot)

* Visualized the cumulative probability to help users obtain insight into how often a certain feature is below a certain value (Cumulative Distribution Plot)

* Added Download button for Histogram, Cumulative Distribution Plot, Autocorrelation Plot, XY Plot, QQ Plot, and Residual Plot and allowed users to enable/disable certain legend elements on charts

## [Project 2: Gender_Recognition_by_Voice](https://github.com/kassiwu/Gender_Recognition_by_Voice)
Gender Recognition by Voice Analysis by Implementing Linear Regression, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest from scratch in Python
#### Technologies
* Python
* Shell Scripting
#### Feature Importance

<img src="/images/IQR.png" width="450"> <img src="/images/meanfun.png" width="450">

We see that the top two features are meanfun and IQR and the first 5 components showed in PCA plot contain approximately 85% of the variance.

IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)

meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal

#### My Contributions
* Created a graphical comparison between two distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other (QQ Plot)
* Visualized the cumulative probability to help users obtain insight into how often a certain feature is below a certain value (Cumulative Distribution Plot)
* Added Download button for Histogram, Cumulative Distribution Plot, Autocorrelation Plot, XY Plot, QQ Plot, and Residual Plot and allowed users to enable/disable certain legend elements on charts
* Integrated “R” into code export of model
